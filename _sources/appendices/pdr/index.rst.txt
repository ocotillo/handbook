Preliminary design review
=========================

The following are downloadable PDFs of documents produced for the MagAO-X preliminary design review on May 2, 2017. **Note that the instrument design has evolved since this review.** Where the rest of the handbook and the attached documents provide conflicting information, the rest of the handbook should be taken as authoritative.

The below sections are also available as a single :download:`combined document <magaox_001_pdr.pdf>`.
