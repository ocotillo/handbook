# xindiserver

## Name

xindiserver âˆ’ wrapper for `indiserver`, integrating it into the MagAO-X ecosystem.

## Synopsis

```
xindiserver [options]
```

`xindiserver` is normally configured with a configuration file, hence all command-line arguments are optional.

### Description

`xindiserver` wraps the standard `indiserver` program in a MagAO-X interface.  This includes exposing configuration options, and capturing logs which are reformatted in the `flatlogs` binary logging system.

### Options

| `-n`  | `--name`          | name                 | string            | The name of the application, specifies config. |
| `-m`  |                   | indiserver.m         | int               | indiserver kills client if it gets more than this many MB behind, default 50 |
| `-N`  |                   | indiserver.N         | bool              | indiserver: ignore /tmp/noindi. Capitalized to avoid conflict with `--name` |
| `-p`  |                   | indiserver.p         | int               | indiserver: alternate IP port, default 7624 |
| `-v`  |                   | indiserver.v         | int               | indiserver: log verbosity, -v, -vv or -vvv |
| `-x`  |                   | indiserver.x         | bool              | exit after last client disconnects -- FOR PROFILING ONLY |
| `-L`  | `--local`         | local.drivers        | vector of strings | List of local drivers to start. |
| `-R`  | `--remote`        | remote.drivers       | vector of string  | List of remote drivers to start, in the form of name\@hostname without the port.  Hostname needs an entry in remote.hosts |
| `-H`  | `--hosts`         | remote.hosts         | vector of string  | List of remote hosts, in the form of `hostname[:remote_port]:local_port`.  `remote_port` is optional if it is the INDI default. |

## Driver Specifications

Lists of driver names are passed to `xindiserver` via the configuration system.  Drivers can be either local or remote.

Driver names can not be repeated, whether local or remote.

### Local Drivers

Drivers running on the same machine are specified by their names only.  On the command line this would be
```
--local=driverX,driverY,driverZ
```
and in the configuration file this would be
```
[local]
drivers=driverX,driverY,driverZ
```

### Remote Drivers

Drivers running a remote machine are specified by their names and the name of the SSH tunnel to that machine.  `xindiserver` parses the `sshTunnels.conf` config file as part of configuration.

NOTE: the tunnel specification is by the tunnel name (the section in the config file), not the host name.

On the command line this would be
```
--remote=driverR@tunnel_name_1,driverS@tunnel_name_2,driverT@tunnel_name_1
```
and in the configuration file this would be
```
[remote]
drivers=driverR@tunnel_name_1,driverS@tunnel_name_2,driverT@tunnel_name_1
```

In both cases it must be true that `sshTunnels.conf` contains a valid tunnel specification for `tunnel_name_1` and `tunnel_name_2`.

### Exit Status

If there are no errors `xindiserver` runs until killed.

If the specified port is already in use, i.e. due to a previously running `indiserver`, then `xindiserver` will produce a log entry, change to state FAILURE, and exit.

If the `indiserver` process exits for any reason, then `xindiserver` will produce a log entry, change to state FAILURE, and exit.

If the `xindidriver` program for a driver reports that it can not get a lock, which indicates that another instance of `xindidriver` already has the FIFO open, then `xindiserver` will produce a log entry, change to state FAILURE, and exit.


## Troubleshooting

If `indiserver` exits abnormally (this is extremly rare, and is not expected except due to operator error!), it can leave the `xindidriver` processes running.  A subsequent attempt to restart will fail when new instances of `xindidriver` can not lock the FIFOs.  The solution is manually kill each of the `xindidriver` processes, which will have the symlinked names of the `MagAOXApp` they are communicating with.
