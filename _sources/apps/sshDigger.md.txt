# sshDigger

## Name

sshDigger âˆ’ the MagAO-X SSH tunnel manager

## Synopsis

```
$ sshDigger [options] -n tunnel_name
```

The `tunnel_name` denotes the section in the configuration file(s) which contains the specification of the tunnel.  `sshDigger` is normally configured via a base configuration file, hence all other command-line arguments are optional.

## Description

`sshDigger` uses the `autossh` utility to form a robust `SSH` tunnel or port forward to a remote host.  In addition, the forked `autossh` process is monitored, and if it dies a new one is created.

The base configuration is normally located at `/opt/MagAOX/config/sshTunnels.conf`.  It should contain options applicable to all tunnels, as well as the tunnel definitions themselves.

The tunnel name must be specified with the `-n` command line option.

This app does not require that an instance specific configuration `tunnel_name.conf` be available.  If one is available matching the name given with the `-n tunnel_name` option, then any settings contained therein will override those given in the base config file.

## Tunnel Specification

Tunnels are specified by a section in the configuration files, normally the base `sshTunnels.conf` file.  The section must have the following members

```
[tunnel_name]
remoteHost=resolvable_name
localPort=X
remotePort=Y
```

Where
- `resolvable_name` is an ip address or host name.  This can include a user name `user@` at the beginning if needed.
- `X` denotes the integer local port number.
- `Y` denotes the integer remote port number

This results in `ssh` being started with

```
$ ssh -nNTL X:localhost:Y resolvable_name
```

by the `autossh` utility.

| `-n`  | `--name`          | name                 | string        | The name of the application, specifies config. |

TODO: add more of the config options, make -n required.


`*` format in the config file column is section.option which implies the format:
```
[section]
option=value
```
in the config file.

## INDI Properties

This app does not use INDI.

## Exit Status

`sshDigger` runs until killed, and will restart `autossh`, which in turn restarts `ssh`, as long as it is running.  Use the `logdump` utility to examine the process log for errors.


## Examples

To create an SSH tunnel for `magaox_aoc_to_rtc_indi`:
```
$ /opt/MagAOX/bin/sshDigger -n magaox_aoc_to_rtc_indi
```

Which expects a configuration entry of the form:
```
[magaox_aoc_to_rtc_indi]
remoteHost=rtc
localPort=7630
remotePort=7624
```

This then securely forwards traffic from `localhost:7630` to the INDI server on `rtc:7624`.
