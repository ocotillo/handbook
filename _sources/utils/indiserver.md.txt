# indiserver

## Name

indiserver − provide socket access to one or more local or remote INDI drivers

## Synopsis
```
indiserver [options] driver [driver ...]
```

## Description

indiserver is a TCP server that provides network access to any number of local INDI Driver programs or INDI Devices running on other indiservers in a chained fashion.

## Driver

Each additional argument can be either the name of a local program to run or a specification of an INDI Device on a remote indiserver.

A local program is specified as the path name of the execuble to run (not the name of the Device it implements). The program is presumed to implement the INDI protocol on its stdin and stdout channels to implement exactly one Device. The program may send ad-hoc out-of-band error or trace messages to its stderr, each line of which will be prefixed with the name of the Device and a timestamp then is merged in with the indiserver’s stderr.

A remote Device is given in the form device@host\[:port\], where device is the INDI device already available on another running instance of indiserver, host is the TCP host name on which said instance is running and the optional port is the port on which to connect if other than the standard port 7624. Again, remote connections specify the name of the Device, irrespective of the name of its local driver program. This remote connection ability is referred to as indiserver "chaining".

Indiserver will attempt to restart a driver that dies unless the file /tmp/noindi exists. Automatically restarting drivers helps create a more robust environment for clients, and allows for easily killing and restarting a driver any number of times during driver development without also killing indiserver and restarting clients.

Indiserver queues messages separately for each client and driver in an attempt to avoid slow consumers from effecting faster consumers. However, if a client ever gets more than 50MB behind in its queue (or as set using -m), it is considered hopelessly slow and is shut down.

## Exit Status

`indiserver` is intended to run forever and so never exits normally. If it does exit, it prints a message to stderr and exits with status 1.

## Examples

In the following discussion, suppose there are driver programs named `cam`, `ota` and `tmount` which implement INDI devices Camera, OTA and Mount, respectively.

Remote `indiserver` connections are useful in several scenarios. One possibility is to allow Drivers to run on platforms most appropriate to the hardware they are controlling and yet be combined with Devices on other platforms. For example, suppose a camera device requires a special hardware connection and dedicated processing so its driver is run on `host1`. Other devices are simpler and can be run on `host2`. In this case, the camera device might be run as follows (the prompt denotes the host name):
```
host1: indiserver cam
```
and combined with other drivers as follows:
```
host2: indiserver Camera@host1 ota tmount
```
In this way an INDI client connecting to host2 seemlessly sees all the devices Camera, OTA and Mount.

This technique can also be used to manage which Devices are available to INDI clients depending on where they connect. Continuing with the example before, if a client connects to host1 it will only see device Camera, but clients connecting to host2 will see Camera, OTA and Mount. In this way, certain devices can be hidden from, say, external access to a facility.
