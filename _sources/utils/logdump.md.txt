# logdump

## Name

logdump âˆ’ prints MagAO-X binary log files in a readable format.

## Synopsis

```
logdump [options] appname
```

## Description


logdump reads the log file(s) for the app specified with `appname`.  Possible modes of operation are:
- Print entries from all log files present (default if no other options are given)
- Print just the N most recent files, specified with `--nfiles``
- Follow the application's logs, printing each new entry untill logdump is killed.
- In any of these cases, the minimum log level can be specified.
- In any of these cases, the output can be limited to a specific event code or set of codes.

`logdump` by default looks in the MagAO-X system log directory, normally `/opt/MagAOX/logs`.  This can be changed with thte `--dir` option.

| `-d`  | `--dir`               | dir               | string     | Directory to search for logs. MagAO-X default is normally used. |
| `-e`  | `--ext`               | ext               | string     | The file extension of log files. MagAO-X default is normally used. |
| `-n`  | `--nfiles`            | nfiles            | int        | Number of log files to dump.  If 0, then all matching files dumped. Default: 0, 1 if following. |

Note  that only the mininum unique string is required. |
| `-C`  | `--code`              | code              | int vector | The event code, or vector of codes, to dump.  If not specified, all codes are dumped.  See logCodes.hpp for a complete list of codes. |



## Exit Status

How `logdump` exits depends on the mode of operation.  If it is printing all or a set number of log files, it will exit normally after printing the last entry.  If it is following a log, it will not exit until signaled (e.g. with `ctrl-c`).

## Examples


To dump all the log entries for the application `trippLitePDU0`:

```
$ logdump trippLitePDU0
```

To dump just the last 2 log files:

```
$ logdump -n 2 trippLitePDU0
```

To show only log entries with level WARNING or higher:

```
$ logdump -n2 -L W trippLitePDU0
```

To show only specific log entries, in this case change of PDU outlet state, run:

```
$ logdump -C 12001,12002 trippLitePDU0
```

To follow the log, showing log level WARNING or higher:

```
$ logdump -L W -f trippLitePDU0
```
